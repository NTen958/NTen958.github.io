<div id="aboutme">
 Hi I'm Ninah

I'm 16 and my Birthday is January 6th, 2003.
When I was little I was in the hospital for 9 months because I was really sick as a baby.
I was born with a condition called Short Gut Syndrome which makes me not get the right proteins and nutrients and minerals when I eat food.
Anyways
I'm gonna be a Junior in High school.
I go to Oak Park and River Forest High School.
This is my first time doing Girls Who Code and so far the coding is fun but its really hard to take it in ,becasue I have learning disabilities and my brain doesn't process things very fast.
I need help when it comes to fast things, it makes it easier when I earn by doing and seeing.
Surprising but not Surprisingly I have had really good grade through high school and been on The Honor Rolls many and im very proud of myself for my hard work.
